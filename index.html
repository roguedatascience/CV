	<h3>Why me</h3>
	
	<p>More than a discipline, I have come to understand data science as a set of tools intended to answering questions, both easy and hard. But regardless of their complexity, it is the quality of the questions that most impacts the extent and the reach of the answers. Throughout my academic and professional lives, I have been exposed to a vast variety of questions: from questions about the importance of musicology in the cultural history of Latin America, to how to better evaluate development loans and projects; from how to accurately measure emotion, to how to systematically answer “what pops?” in a survey. And beyond what I can do with data, algorithms and code, I believe my greatest strength is finding, understanding and translating those truly great questions, regardless of their origin, into a structure and a logic that allow the tools of data science to shine.</p>
